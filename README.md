## Welcome to Esraa Khaled Website
 I have always been passionate in the Machine Learning, and Data Science fields. After graduating from Systems and Biomedical department, Faculty of Engineering, Cairo University in 2021 with very good grade with honors. I got an internship opportunity from Ministry of Communication to make my master's degree. With a master's degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science from Queen's University, Canada, that I have just finished, this made me gain a lot of experience in those fields. During my study through the college years, and through the master's, I worked on vast Python based projects. So, I have excellent knowledge in it.I used it in several fields in the AI development field, as I made many projects in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Science, Big Data, Data Analysis, and Business Intelligence.​I am Looking for an interactive and innovative environment where I can apply and develop my knowledge and skills.

Enjoy! (;
